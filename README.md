# Demo FastAPI, GraphQL and MongoDB Integration

This project integrates FastAPI, GraphQL and MongoDB to create a powerful and flexible API. 
FastAPI provides a fast and secure platform for building RESTful APIs. GraphQL enables 
efficient data fetching, allowing clients to request only the data they need. MongoDB is 
used as a database to store and retrieve data quickly and reliably. Together, these 
technologies provide an efficient and secure way to build a web application/API with dynamic data.
